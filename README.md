  ## Description

  I started this project from scratch and used bootstrap to set up my html, just a simple navbar and jumbotron. 
  Most of the difficulties in this project were from the javascript portion. I first started off with making a bunch of variables that I was going to need throughout the functions. Then I added a timer to that counts down but couldn't figure out how to get it to stop counting down and bring you to the final page to register your score if you didn't finish in time. The timer does inculed sections that allow for the score to be based off of the time and for it to start the questions once the start button for the timer is activated. The next section was for the questions to pop up in and the answers to be listed below it. The questions were pulled from an array that is located in the next section. The array has the questions, answers, and correct answers all listed. The answer choices can be pulled from in another array within the array. I then made a section that evalutes the answer chosen with the correct answer and compares them to see if you will have time deducted from the time remaining. It will then move to the next question in the array. I then have a section that allows for all the input fields to appear and for the user to put their initials in. Finally the information was placed into local storage in the linked highScores.html. 
  The highScores.html has two buttons, one for clearing any locally stored information and the other for going back to the starting page. The last thing it does is store and show the information that was input in the previous javascript file that was linked.
  I did use some google fu for this assignment, the APIs are a bit over my head and I know that there are somethings in my application that don't work. This was easily the hardest homnework assignment so far and without external resources I think I would have gotten half of the code correctly.
